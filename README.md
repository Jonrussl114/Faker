Faker is multi-threaded application using C#. It acts as a social media service that runs locally on the system where users can create an account, make a post, view their and other users' posts,
exit and create a new account, and switch to a different account that was already created.
To properly download and use Faker:
1. Make sure you download the C# .NET SDK from Microsoft if you have a Microsoft OS device. If not then there should be an option for Linux and Mac OS.
2. Download Visual Studio Code if you have not already and install the C# Dev Kit and C# extensions.
3. Go back to the GitHub page of Faker and select the green "<> Code" dropdown menu, then select "Download ZIP" and extract the zip folder.
4. Once ready select in the Explorer window of Visual Studio Code and select "Open Folder".
5. When the folder opens, double-click "Program.cs" from the sidebar and now you should be able to run Faker in the Terminal using "dotnet run" or pressing the play button at the very top of the window.
Note: To see what version of .NET SDK you have, type in the Terminal "dotnet --version".
